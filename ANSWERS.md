# Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using Mark Down.
1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
While they both iterate over a list, .map will make the needed changes and return a new list. .foreach doesnt actually return anything, it just copies the funtion over each array item and stops with the next line of code. 

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
A Function is a piece of code that takes in info (stings, numbers, Booleans, ext) and returns data based on that info. While a method can be very similar, a Method is a piece of code that runs inside a set {object} in Javascript. Methods return data based on that object that is instance-like. They can make prototypes of data and make 'copies' of orignal pieces of code. 

3. What is closure?
Closures make it possible for us to make other variable 'private'. Basically, we want our function to have access to the parent scope even if the parent scope has closed. closure makes that possibe.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
Implicit>left of the'.' Explict> .apply .call .bind New> New keyword  Window> window binding.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
<blockquote>	used to call the parent class 'constructor'  function and to inherit attributes from the parent. 
Without it there would be no inheritance!

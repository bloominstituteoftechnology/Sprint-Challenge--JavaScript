# Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using Mark Down.
1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
<!--The biggest difference between the two is that .forEach is a method that iterates over an array, but it overrides or changes the existing array. However, the map method just does the same thing, but it returns a new array without affecting the existing one.-->
2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
<!--A function is a reusable block of code that can be called within your program at any given time. A method is inside an object that gives the given object an action-->
3. What is closure?
<!--Closure is where you have a function nested inside another function that still has access to the variables of the parent function when it was invoked-->
4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
<!--Implicit: When you give the object a method to act on. The object that is immediately to the left of the method is assigned to this, Explicit: When you pass in the object that will be used for the this keyword as a parameter in the function, Window: When you don't give any instruction to what is assigned to the this keyword, it looks at what the windows is assigned by default, New Binding: When you use the this keyword to bind to a variable that is going to be set by parameters that are entered or passed into the object or function-->
5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
<!--We need super in an extended class so that we can give access to the variables in the existing class to the new class that has been created.-->

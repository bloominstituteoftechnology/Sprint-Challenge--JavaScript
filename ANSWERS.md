# Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using Mark Down.
1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
The difference is the '.map' method returns a value, specifically an array.
2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
The differences is that a method is declared inside of an object as an attribute.
3. What is closure?

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
When used in the global scope, 'this' binds to the global objects. In an implicit binding, 'this' refers to the immediate preceding object. Using the new binding, 'this' is now binded to an instance of an object. Lastly, for explicit bindings, 'this' is assigned with the '.call' or '.apply' methods on the parent object.
5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
The 'super' keyword allows access to the parent object.

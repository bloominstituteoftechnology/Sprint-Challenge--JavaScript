# Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using Markdown.
1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
  1. Answer: The biggest difference between .forEach and .map is that map return as new Array automatically.
            .map performs the same operation on each item as does .forEach.
2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
  2. Answer: The difference between a function and an method is that a function is outside of a parent object and a method lives within an object.
3. What is closure?
  3. Answer: Closure is unique in that the function will go outside of it's local scope to reference a variable. I don't know where the word lexical comes into play.
4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
  4. Answer:
    Window Binding: :this: could be bound to the window or the view-port that :this: is in if not placed more specifically.
    Implicit Binding: :this: is implied on where it is meant to reference. Its area of reference is automatically assumed.
    Explicit Binding: :this: is explicitly stated what is to be refrenced.
    New Binding: :this: is used in a constructor function to create a new binding for use in other instances.

1. Some of the differences between `.foreach` and `.map` are that `.foreach` is that `.map` returns a new array of elements while in turn passing each element back to the callback. While the `.foreach` iterates a function that we use as a callback to access the items in an array that will come back with a pass. 
2. Five different data types in JavaScript are Boolean, String, Number, Null, Undefined. Arrays are special because there is always order. They also allows us to use data. 
3. A closure is example of a function that has access to a variable in an outer scope. 
Example of Closure:

const name: 'Cris';
function myName () {
    console.log(name);
}
name();
4. Four rules of the `.this` are the following:
-Window/Global Object Binding
-Implicit Binding
-New Binding 
-Explicit Binding

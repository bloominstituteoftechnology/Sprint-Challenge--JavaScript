1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.

  The biggest difference is that `.map` returns a new array, while `.forEach`
  acts like a for loop, iterating through each index of the array and performing
  the requested function upon it.  For example, `.forEach` can mutate an
  existing array, while `.map` will return a new array mutated from the original.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  A function is a block of code that be declared in a program, and then re-used,
  throughout a program by invoking it.  A method is a function that is bound to
  and object, usually by being declared inside of that object, or attached to
  that object's prototype.  Methods must be invoked through an object, while
  functions can be invoked independently.

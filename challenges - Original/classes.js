// Copy and paste your prototype in here and refactor into class syntax.

// Test your volume and surfaceArea methods by uncommenting the logs below:
// console.log(cuboid.volume()); // 100
// console.log(cuboid.surfaceArea()); // 130

/* Stretch Task:

  Extend the base class CuboidMaker with a sub class called CubeMaker.  Find out the formulas for volume and surface area for cubes and create those methods as well.  Create a new cube object and log out the results of your new cube.

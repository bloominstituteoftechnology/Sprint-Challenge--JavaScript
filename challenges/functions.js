// ==== Callbacks ====

/* Step 1: Create a higher-order function
 * Create a higher-order function named consume with 3 parameters: a, b and cb
 * The first two parameters can take any argument (we can pass any value as argument)
 * The last parameter accepts a callback
 * The consume function should return the invocation of cb, passing a and b into cb as arguments
 */
function consume(a, b, cb) {
  return cb(a, b);
}
console.log(8, 73);

/* Step 2: Create several functions to callback with consume();
 * Create a function named add that returns the sum of two numbers
 * Create a function named multiply that returns the product of two numbers
 * Create a function named greeting that accepts a first and last name and returns "Hello first-name last-name, nice to meet you!"
 */

const add = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
const multiply = (num1, num2) => num1 * num2;
const greeting = (firstName, lastName) =>
  `Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}, nice to meet you`;
/* Step 3: Check your work by un-commenting the following calls to consume(): */
console.log(consume(2, 2, add)); // 4
console.log(consume(10, 16, multiply)); // 160
console.log(consume("Mary", "Poppins", greeting)); // Hello Mary Poppins, nice to meet you!

// ==== Closures ====

// Explain in your own words why nested function can access the variable internal.

//! Explanation: nested fuction can be retured, as a property or by itself-basicly this means the outer fuction creats a object with methods, you can use this elsewhere- it will have accsess to it regardless where it is at.

const external = "I'm outside the function";

function myFunction() {
  console.log(external);
  const internal = "Hello! I'm inside myFunction!";

  function nestedFunction() {
    console.log(internal);
  }
  nestedFunction();
}
myFunction();
